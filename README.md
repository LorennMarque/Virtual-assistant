# Virtual-assistant with Python
I am learning python and this is the first project I have done, it can be further developed by adding more and more functions, but it is a good base to start with

At first i had some problems with PyAudio, if you have the same problem try downloading a different version on this website

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

look for "pyAudio" (ctrl + f)

If the newest version dont work (PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl)

Try using this one PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl
